# Write a function that accepts two parameters: number of guests, number of pancakes per guest.  
# The calculation for the total number of pancakes should be 12% higher than the number of guests multiplied by the number of pancakes per guest, 
# rounded up to the nearest whole number. Print the result to the console.

# Call your function to make sure it is working correctly. For example, 10 guests with 3 pancakes each = 34 pancakes total
